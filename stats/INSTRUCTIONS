Script: stats_mean.sh $1

Gets mean and maximum time from reads, proccess and writes from 
$1 file.
 
$1 file have a name structured like stats_B_T_SCHED.omp, where:
	B = Batch size
	T = Thread number
	SCHED = OpenMP 'for' schedule type

$1 fileS must be generated by recalibrator

$1 files content consist in text lines like:
	R P W MR MP MW
	R P W MR MP MW
	...
R = Time in read
P = Time in proccess
W = Time in write
MX = Max time in X

Output is one text line with the form:
	R P W MR MP MW
where every field is the mean from the input file fields.

===============================================================
Script: stats_recollect.sh $1 $2

Get in one output file all means from $1 schedule type and $2 
batch size.
	$1 = Schedule type (static, dynamic, guided...)
	$2 = Batch size

This scripts uses stats_mean.sh script to obtain data from every
recalibrator output stats file. Files with form 
	'stats_$2_X_$1.omp'
will be recollected. X is a number and represents number of 
threads.

Recollected data is stored by text line in the form:
	T R P W MR MP MW
	T R P W MR MP MW
	...
T = Number of threads
R, P, W, MR, MP, MW = like in stats_mean.sh script.

This scripts print results to an output file with a name like:
	'stats_results_$2_$1.omp'

===============================================================
Script: stats_plot.sh $1

Uses GNUPlot to plot a graphic with 2 axys:
	x axis = Number of threads
	y axis = Execution time

$1 is a file generated by stats_recollect.sh script with the
form:
	'stats_results_B_SCHED.omp'
B = Batch size
SCHED = Schedule type used by 'for' OpenMP (static, dynamic, guided...)

Plot contains three lines for reads, proccess and writes times.
